Solution approach
1. Data understanding and exploring
2. Data cleaning
• Handling missing values 
• Outliers treatment
3. Exploratory data analysis
• Univariate analysis
• Bivariate analysis
4. Prepare the data for modelling 
• Check the skewness of the data and mitigate it for fair analysis
5. Split the data into train and test set
• Scale the data (normalization)
6. Model building
• Train the model with various algorithm such as Logistic regression, SVM, 
Decision Tree, Random forest etc.
• Tune the hyperparameters with Grid Search Cross Validation and find the 
optimal values of the hyperparameters
7. Model evaluation 
• As we see that the data is heavily imbalanced, Accuracy may not be the 
correct measure for this particular case
